  ## Installation

  "If a prospective employer wanted to download and test the readme generator, they'd first clone the repo, then run the command 'npm install' to download the application's dependencies into the node_modules folder. For this reason, we never upload the node_modules folder into GitHub"

  ## Usage
  This is a descrtiption of the project. It should be as detailed as possible.

  NOTE: I have no idea what goes here yet...

  ## License
  MIT

  NOTE: The licenses for the application need to be selected from a list of options with a badge that is added near the top of the README. In addition, there needs to be a notice added to this section of the README that explains which license the application is covered under.

  QUESTION: What are the options for licenses anyway?
